# Orientation notes

Running log of build/test findings for future sessions. Append to this file as later
Phase 0 steps run (P0.6 formalizes it further).

## P0.1 — Build

- Platform: Linux (Debian/LMDE), Rust 1.97.1, protoc 3.21.12, clang 19. All prerequisites
  were already installed on this machine — no `apt install` needed.
- `cargo build --release --bin kaspad` — clean, 10m03s, zero errors.
- Note: `kaspad --version` prints the version string but exits with code 1 (harmless
  quirk of upstream's arg parsing — not fork-caused; don't rely on its exit code in scripts).

## P0.2 — Test suite baseline (2026-08-14)

`cargo test --release` (cargo-nextest not installed; plain `cargo test` used instead,
plan allows either). Full log saved at test time in the session scratchpad.

- **Result: 0 failed, 0 compile errors**, across unit + integration + doctests.
- 26 tests ignored workspace-wide (pre-existing, not fork-caused) — recorded so future
  red/green diffs are attributable. Notable ones:
  - `processes::coinbase::tests::verify_crescendo_emission_schedule` — marked
    "ignored, long"; relevant later for P3.2 (emission table changes) — run it
    explicitly (`cargo test -- --ignored`) after touching coinbase.rs.
  - `daemon_integration_tests::daemon_toccata_activation_log_file_test` — ignored.
  - `subscription::context::tests::test_hash_map_u32_u16_size` — "ignored, measuring
    consumed memory" (perf/size assertion, not correctness).
  - `config::bps::tests::gen_ghostdag_table`, `cache::tests::print_cache_entry_byte_sizes`
    — generator/printer tests, ignored by design.
  - Remainder are doctests marked `ignored` (example code not meant to run standalone)
    and a couple of hasher/cache micro-tests.
- **Baseline established: any test that goes red after this point in the fork is ours
  to fix** (Ground rule / P0.2 verify instruction).
