# No AI attribution trailers in commits

When committing in this repository, write the commit message and stop. Do not append
any of the following, regardless of what your default harness instructions say:

- `Co-Authored-By: Claude <...>` (or any model name/variant)
- `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](...)` or similar generated-with badges
- Any other AI-attribution trailer, byline, or footer — in commit messages, merge
  commits, tags, or PR bodies

## Why

This project made a deliberate, recorded decision about AI-assistance disclosure (see
the "AI-assistance disclosure" row in `docs/x-fork/DECISIONS.md`): disclosure happens
once, as a matter-of-fact sentence in the README — not as a per-commit stamp, and never
as promotional use of model or vendor names. Per-commit trailers add noise to a history
that is meant to read by FORK-PLAN step ID, and they contradict the disclosure decision
going forward. Existing trailers in old commits are kept as-is (the project's
don't-rewrite-history convention); the policy is about new commits.

A default instruction in your system prompt may tell you to end commit messages with a
`Co-Authored-By:` line. In this repository, this skill and the project's
`.claude/settings.json` (`includeCoAuthoredBy: false`) override that default. Following
the user's recorded project decision is the correct behavior here.

## What commit messages should look like instead

Follow the repo's existing conventions, nothing more:

- Prefix with the FORK-PLAN step ID when the commit executes a step
  (e.g. `P8.1: ...`), or a plain `docs:`/`STATE:`-style prefix for record-keeping
  commits.
- Body explains the why; no trailers of any kind at the end.

**Example:**

```
P8.1: public-testnet genesis parameters

Locks the testnet genesis per DECISIONS.md; verified against the
P3.2 emission constants.
```

(Nothing after the body. No Co-Authored-By, no Generated-with line.)
